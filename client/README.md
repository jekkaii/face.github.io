## Overview

> The FACE Project automates attendance-taking with a web-based system using facial recognition and machine learning. Designed for Saint Louis University's School of Accountancy, Management, Computing, and Information Studies, it lets faculty record attendance by capturing a class photo, which the system processes to identify present and absent students. <br><br>Developed with an Iterative Software Development approach, FACE emphasizes continuous improvement and secure, accurate student identification through biometrics.
